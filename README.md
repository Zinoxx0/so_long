# So_Long

Welcome to the So_Long project!

This project is a 42 project that aims to create a simple 2D game using the MinilibX library. It involves creating a game where the player navigates through a maze, collects items, and avoids obstacles.

Please note that this project is still in its early stages and is a work in progress. Expect frequent updates and changes as we continue to develop and improve the game.

**Disclaimer: This project is a very early work in progress (WIP) and may contain bugs, incomplete features, and other issues. Use at your own risk.**
